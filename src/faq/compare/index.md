Title: ScottPlot vs. Similar Libraries - ScottPlot FAQ
Description: Similarities and differences of ScottPlot vs. other popular .NET plotting libraries

# ScottPlot Philosophy

**ScottPlot was created to:**

* Easily display plots with tens of millions of points
* Be fast enough to interactively pan/zoom with the mouse
* Function in console applications or server environments
* Prevent the user from having to learn a complex object model
  * Data input is often simply `double[]`
  * Data can be displayed using a single line of code
