# What's New in ScottPlot 4.1

**ScottPlot 4.1 replaced ScottPlot 4.0 in May, 2021.** This page summarizes major new features and changes likely to be encountered when upgrading from ScottPlot 4.0 and 4.1.

### Major New Features
* Support for multiple X and Y axes
* Extensive new customization options for axes, ticks, and grids
* Stateless rendering for improved performance and thread safety
* Simplified common configuration module for user controls
* Support for render requests that don't block the UI thread
* Improved event handling to allow customization of user controls

### Methods to Add Plottables Have New Names

Methods now start with the word `Add`. This is consistent with the fact that custom plottables can be instantiated and passed into `Plot.Add()`, and also makes it more obvious that a `Plot.Clear()` exists.

```cs
var plt = new ScottPlot.Plot();

// ScottPlot 4.0
plt.PlotBar()
plt.PlotSignal()
plt.PlotScatter()

// ScottPlot 4.1
plt.AddBar()
plt.AddSignal()
plt.AddScatter()
```

### Improved Naming for Plottables

Plottables are now in the `ScottPlot.Plottable` namespace and may have been renamed to improve readability. Public fields and methods have been renamed and capitalized to be more discoverable and idiomatic.

```cs
// ScottPlot 4.0
var old = new ScottPlot.PlottableBar();
old.fillColor = Color.Red;
old.lineWidth = 3;

// ScottPlot 4.1
var new = new ScottPlot.Plottable.BarPlot();
new.FillColor = Color.Red;
new.LineWidth = 3;
```

### Axis Manipulation

Setting and getting axis limits is a little more refined.

```cs
// ScottPlot 4.0
plt.Axis(x1: -10, x2: 10);
double[] oldLimits = plt.Axis();
Console.WriteLine($"horizontal from {oldLimits[0]} to {oldLimits[1]}");

// ScottPlot 4.1
plt.SetAxisLimits(xMin: -10, xMax: 10);
AxisLimits newLimits = plt.GetAxisLimits();
Console.WriteLine($"horizontal from {newLimits.XMin} to {newLimits.XMax}");
```

### Axis Styling

Configuration methods with dozens of optional arguments have been replaced by individual axis objects and smaller methods.

```cs
// ScottPlot 4.0
plt.Ticks(dateTimeX: true, xTickRotation: 45);

// ScottPlot 4.1
plt.XAxis.DateTimeFormat(enable: true);
plt.XAxis.TickLabelStyle(rotation: 45);
```

### Modifying Data in Plottables

To reduce likelihood of accidentally putting plottable data into a bad state, most plottables now have public `Update()` methods for replacing data arrays.

```cs
// ScottPlot 4.0
var old = plt.PlotScatter(xs, ys);
old.xs = newXs;
old.ys = newYs;

// ScottPlot 4.1
var new = plt.AddScatter(xs, ys);
new.Update(newXs, newYs);
```

### User Control Configuration

All controls now share a common `Configuration` class with public fields and methods which replace functionality that used to be found in the `Configure()` method.

```cs
// ScottPlot 4.0
formsPlot1.Configure(enableScrollWheelZoom: true);

// ScottPlot 4.1
formsPlot1.Configuration.ScrollWheelZoom = true;
```
