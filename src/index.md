### Plot in the Cloud

**This figure is an example of ScottPlot running in the cloud.** Once daily an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) logs the number of stars this repository has and creates a graph of the star history using ScottPlot. Since the output is simply a static image accessible by a URL, it can be displayed in places where JavaScript is not permitted like in this readme file. Rendering plots server-side allows automatically-updating plots to be displayed in many interesting places. Source code can be found in the [StarGraph](https://github.com/swharden/StarGraph) repository.
